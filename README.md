# StockAlgoFiles-Experiment-
Experimental work involving working with machine learning and stock data. Since it is more experimental, it is less well documented. For preview: ReinforcementLearning.py consists of a simple Q learning algorithm that is then modeled by several of the cells in the python notebook and is backtested using the TradingQC.py file. Other documents include other machine learning algorithms/tests along with code for exporting stock data to excel.
